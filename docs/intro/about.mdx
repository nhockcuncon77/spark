## What is Blindly?

Blindly is a next-generation dating experience that flips the usual script: we ask people to meet each other first as personalities, not pictures. Profiles show hobbies, personality traits, values and short bios. Photos are hidden until a genuine connection has formed.

This design reduces bias, rewards quality conversation, and encourages authentic interactions that stand a better chance of turning into something real.

---

## Core philosophy

* ### Person > Picture

  First impressions should be about character and compatibility — not a thumbnail.

* ### Connection before looks

  Photos are revealed only after mutual, meaningful engagement.

* ### Authenticity & safety

  Strong identity verification, human review where needed, and transparent AI keep the product humane and trustworthy.

## Quick tour — How Blindly works

### 1. Onboarding

* Verify identity (government ID + liveness check)
* Choose hobbies and interests
* Complete personality questions (Likert style)
* Write a bio (or generate one with AI)
* Upload photos (kept hidden by default)

### 2. Discovery

* Browse profiles with non-identifying aesthetics
* No swipe frenzy — intentional browsing and recommendations

### 3. Match & Chat

* Mutual interest opens a chat
* AI helpers (optional) suggest bios or reply drafts
* The platform monitors conversation quality (spam reduction; signal over noise)

### 4. Unlock → Reveal

* After a minimum threshold of meaningful messages, either user can request reveal
* Both must accept to unlock photos
* Photos are encrypted and only revealed under mutual consent

### 5. Rating & Feedback

* After reveal, both users rate the interaction (0–10)
* A score ≥ 7 keeps the match alive; below 7 gracefully closes it
* Ratings feed the recommendation engine to improve future matches

## AI — Helpful, labeled, optional

Blindly uses transparent AI tools to empower users — never to impersonate humans.

**Examples**

* **AI Bio Generator** — Tailored prompts to capture your voice.
* **AI Rizz Farmer** — Contextual, editable reply suggestions to keep conversations flowing.
* **AI Conversation Coach** — Tone and clarity suggestions to help you say what you mean.
* **Virtual AI Companion** — A labeled assistant that learns your preferences and suggests matches.

## Matching algorithm (brief)

Blindly’s hybrid recommendation engine blends:

* **Semantic vectors** (user hobbies, traits, message content encoded into embeddings)
* **Conversation-quality signals** (length, reciprocity, intent)
* **Post-reveal ratings** (private feedback that refines "who you're attracted to")
* **Behavioral patterns** (response times, engagement styles)

This allows matches to evolve with you, improving quality over time.

---

## Social discovery

A lightweight social layer (think short posts / micro-updates) lets users share ideas while remaining anonymous:

* Hidden identity posts show hobby badge + personality headline
* Users can **Poke** authors — the author sees hobby + personality and can accept or decline
* If accepted, a temporary, photo-hidden chat opens

This encourages organic discovery without exposing appearance.

---

## Safety & verification

Safety is built into every phase:

* Government ID verification + liveness checks
* Encrypted photo storage and controlled reveal flow
* Bot and abuse detection models
* Human review for flagged activity
* Fast reporting, blocking, and escalation tools
* Verified accounts receive a trust boost in recommendations

---

## Privacy snapshot

* Photos remain encrypted and are only revealed under mutual consent.
* AI models may process content to offer features; all AI-assisted outputs are opt-in and labeled.
* Minimal required data is collected for core features (verification, matching, safety).
* Users control discoverability and can delete account data (see full policy).
