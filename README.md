# Spark

**Your own personality-first dating app.** 
**Personality-first dating. Real conversations before photos.**

Spark is a next-generation dating platform that challenges the appearance-first culture of modern dating apps. Instead of swiping on photos, users connect through personality, hobbies, values, and meaningful conversations — with photos revealed only after mutual interest and genuine interaction.

## ✨ What is Spark?

Spark flips the traditional dating model.

- No photos at first  
- No swipe fatigue  
- No appearance-based first impressions  

Users meet as people, not profiles.

Profiles highlight hobbies, personality traits, values, and short bios. Photos stay hidden until both users mutually decide to reveal them after meaningful conversation.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

### Person > Picture  
First impressions should be about who someone is, not how they look.

### Connection Before Looks  
Photos unlock only after real engagement and mutual consent.

### Authenticity & Safety  
Strong verification, transparent AI, and privacy-first design keep the platform safe and human.

## 🔓 How It Works

1. **Onboarding**
   - Identity verification (ID + liveness)
   - Select hobbies and interests
   - Answer personality questions
   - Write a bio (AI-assisted, optional)
   - Upload photos (hidden by default)

2. **Discovery**
   - Browse profiles without photos
   - No swiping — intentional browsing and recommendations

3. **Match & Chat**
   - Mutual interest opens a chat
   - AI can assist replies (optional)
   - Conversation quality is prioritized over volume

4. **Unlock → Reveal**
   - After meaningful back-and-forth, either user can request reveal
   - Both must accept to unlock photos
   - Photos are encrypted and shown only to each other

5. **Rating & Feedback**
   - Private 0–10 rating after reveal
   - ≥7 continues the match
   - <7 closes the connection gracefully
   - Ratings improve future recommendations (never public)

---

## 🤖 AI — Transparent & Optional

Spark uses AI to **assist**, not impersonate.

- AI Bio Generator  
- AI Reply Suggestions (editable)  
- AI Conversation Coach  
- Virtual AI Companion for better recommendations  

All AI-assisted content is clearly labeled and fully optional.

---

## 🌀 Matching System (High Level)

Spark uses a hybrid recommendation engine powered by:

- Shared hobbies and interests  
- Personality compatibility  
- Conversation-quality signals  
- Post-reveal ratings  
- Behavioral patterns  

The system adapts continuously as users interact.

---

## 🌍 Social Discovery

Spark includes a lightweight social layer:

- Anonymous posts (no photos, no names)
- Like, comment, repost
- Discover people by personality and ideas
- “Poke” users to start a temporary, photo-hidden chat

Organic discovery without appearance pressure.

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Privacy

- Government ID verification
- Liveness checks
- Encrypted photo storage
- Controlled reveal system
- Bot & abuse detection
- Manual moderation for risky activity
- Fast reporting & blocking tools

Privacy is foundational, not optional.
