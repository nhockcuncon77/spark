# Commit messages: no co-author

When creating git commits (e.g. via `git commit -m "..."` or suggesting commit messages):

- **Do not** add `Co-authored-by: Cursor` or any `Co-authored-by:` line to the commit message.
- Use only the main commit message line (and optional body). No trailers (Co-authored-by, Signed-off-by, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks for them.

This applies to all commits made in this project.
